            <p>
                The fund is intended to allow local people to set up their own
                activities or projects that will benefit people living in
                Hartcliffe who are experiencing the impact of crime and/or anti
                social behaviour.
            </p>
            <p class="strong">
                The main criteria for the Hartcliffe Safer Streets small grants
                fund are for projects that are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resident led</li>
                <li>
                    Delivering fun, engaging activities that will bring people
                    together and build connections between neighbours
                </li>
                <li>
                    Addressing the impacts of crime and anti social behaviour
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="strong">We also want to support applications that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Support families and young people (but we may also fund
                    applications that don’t work with these groups)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engage people in new or existing services and activities
                </li>
                <li>
                    Promote positive communication and address negative
                    perceptions about the area
                </li>
                <li>Improve skills</li>
                <li>
                    Promote fairness and inclusion for all members of the
                    community
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We can accept applications from any part of Hartcliffe but we
                are particularly interested in projects from or for residents
                who live in our priority area:

                    src="/assets/priorityarea.jpg"

                />

            </figure>

            <p>
                Please still apply if you live in or want to deliver a project
                outside of this target area – as long as you or your project are
                in Hartcliffe.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can apply for an activity such as a one off street party, or
                for a regular session such as a weekly support group for
                neighbours. You can apply for things like venue costs,
                refreshments, equipment or staff costs.
            </p>

            <p>
