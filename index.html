        <h3>Seven Successful Projects!</h3>
        <p>On Saturday 13th May we held a community meeting in Hartcliffe to hear from the various
            projects who applied to the Hartcliffe Safer Streets Fund.</p>

        <p>We had 11 fantastic applications to the fund from groups of residents and community
            organisations with a real range of project ideas. We had a total of £21,374 to award and the
            applications received totalled £35,294. So it was always going to be a difficult decision to
            make!</p>

        <p>We had applications from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1st Hartcliffe Independent Scout Group – this group wanted to hold a taster and
                information day to launch this new scout group for the area.</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe and Withywood Community Partnership wanted some funds for the
                continuation of their barbershop project where young men at risk of engaging in ASB
                get a free haircut and are connected to a youth worker for support.</li>
            <li>Spacemakers. This group based in Wilmott Park wanted to run a graffiti workshop
                for young people during the summer holidays.</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe BMX applied for funding towards ongoing costs of running the BMX track
                and associated summer activities.</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe Coderz – this group applied for two projects – one for a website making
                summer camp and one for a game development summer camp.</li>
            <li>Family and Friends BS13 wanted to run a summer fun day in Millenium Green park.</li>
            <li>Communities Together – this group also applied for two projects – Marvellous
                Mondays and Together Tuesdays. Both of which would provide a range of activities
                for families in the area.</li>
            <li>Feel Good Friday. This is a group of mothers who meet together to hold wellbeing
                activities and offer each other support. They wanted to expand their activity
                programme and hold educational sessions.</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe Club for Young People applied for money towards the provision of a music
                workshop at the club.</li>

        <p>All of the projects were invited to present to the community their ideas. Those present then
            had the opportunity to vote for their favourite 5 projects. When the results were in we were
            able to fully fund 6 projects in full and a seventh received part funding.</p>

        <p>So the successful projects and the amounts awarded were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hartcliffe Coderz received £3,500 for each of their two projects – so a total of £7,000</li>
            <li>Communities Together received £3,500 for each of their two project – so a total of £7,000</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe BMX received £3,500</li>
            <li>Hartcliffe Club for Young People received £3,000</li>
            <li>Spacemakers received £874</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Congratulations to all those successful projects. To find out more about how the projects
            have gone over the summer look out here for information about a Celebration event
            happening in October where we will hear from all the projects.</p>
        <p>We are hoping that the projects that did not get funding can find funds elsewhere and are
            offering support to them to that end, where applicable.</p>

        <h3>Safer Streets</h3>
        <p>
            In 2022 Bristol City Council was awarded funds from the Home
            Office to make improvements to crime and anti-social behaviour.
            The funding is called
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safer-streets-fund-round-4-application-process">Safer
                Streets</a>
            and was to be spent in two areas, Bedminster and Hartcliffe. In
            Hartcliffe the funds were allocated to a range of things,
            including CCTV at Silcox Rd high rise flats, outreach youth
            work, improved street lighting and a community participation
            project.
        </p>

        <h3>Led by Residents</h3>
        <p>
            In October 2022, supported by the Community Development team, a
            group of residents were brought together to co-design a project
            which would encourage community action and build a more
            connected community. The group became known as the Hartcliffe
            Safer Streets team and they hosted a large community event in
            January 2023 to gather the opinions of the community on issues
            relating to crime and anti-social behaviour in Hartcliffe.
            Attendees discussed three questions –
